[1;36mSealGood - Document signing and timestamping via OpenSSL + TSA[0m

Usage: sealgood help genkey { clean inject date sign verify }

COMMANDS:
  genkey    Generate a new password-protected ed25519 key pair
  help      Show this help
  clean     Extract original content without SEALGOOD tags
  inject    Inject SealGood payload into PDF, HTML or PEM file
  date      Timestamp a document via trusted third party (TSA)
  sign      Sign a document with your private key
  verify    Verify document signature and timestamp

  Commands compose into an implicitly ordered pipeline:

  clean | inject | date | sign | verify
    - reads data from stdin
    - comments progress on stderr
    - writes data to stdout

  Whenever input is a file list, the list is enumerated
  and each item is streamed to the processing pipeline.
  The output is packaged in tar+gzip format with cryptographic
  hashes embedded in signed/timestamped filenames
  enumerate
   \
     +-- clean | inject | date | sign | verify

  inject          respects existing SealGood payload;
  date sign       implicitly perform inject;
  date sign       respect existing signature/timestamp;
  enumerate sign  asks private key passphrase only once.

Examples:
  sealgood sign date < contract.pdf > contract_sealgood.pdf
  sealgood verify    < contract_sealgood.pdf
  ls contract*.pdf | sealgood sign date > contracts.tgz
